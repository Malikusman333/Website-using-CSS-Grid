                    <p class="excerpt">A desert is a large area of land which is covered by sand. It has very little water, and only a few plants grow in the area. When we think of deserts, the first thing that comes to our minds is vast areas of sand. Almost all the deserts are covered with sand. Deserts are hot and dry areas where rainfall occurs very rarely. Since there are fewer trees, the rainfall is also less. Therefore, there is always a scarcity of water in the deserts. It is a place where the evaporation of water is more than the amount of rain it receives. People residing in such areas used to travel very long distances to fetch water. <a href="">...</a></p>

                    <p class="excerpt">A beach is a fun place where land meets the sea. It has soft, warm sand where we can build castles or lie down to relax. The beach also has salty water that waves crash onto the shore. People like to swim, surf, or just splash around in it. We can find shells, starfish, and sometimes crabs on a beach. When it’s sunny, we can see the sparkling sea and feel the cool breeze. At sunset, the sky turns pretty colors. Beaches are great for picnics, playing games, or just watching the sea. It’s a happy place to visit.  <a href="">...</a></p>

                    <p class="excerpt">Mountains are a very popular and attractive destination for tourists. Especially in summer, people like to go to hilly areas with their family and friends. They spend their vacation relaxing in the lapse of the mountain. The scenic beauty of mountains makes their eyes shine and refreshes their mind, which ultimately gives them peace. The mountains are also liked by young people. They like to come here and do adventure activities. Some of the popular activities are paragliding, river rafting, bicycling, trekking, hang gliding and skiing. <a href="">...</a></p>
